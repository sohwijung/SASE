        <p> Cornell Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) is a professional organization
        dedicated to build a caring community to help students advance their future careers through
        workshops, conferences, and fun social/cultural events. Through SASE, students will be able
        to network with company recruiters as well as other SASE members from other universities
        such as MIT, Clarkson, Pittsburgh, Colorado School of Mines, UCSD, and etc. In addition,
        SASE, students will also have the opportunity to attend the annual SASE National Conference

        through the workshops and social events offer on campus and to build lifelong friendships with
